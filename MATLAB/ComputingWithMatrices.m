% element wise multiplication of matrices

newmat = MAt1 .* Mat2 

% each element is multiplied to correspending element of other matrix.
% use DOT for the element wise operation

abs(matrix)
log(mat1)
exp(mat1)
abs(mat1)

max(mat1) % returns the maximum value of the matrix1
[val,index] = max(mat1)  % returns index also 

mat1 < 3 % returns all lelements as 0 or 1 which are less than 1 
find(mat1<3)

floor(mat1)
ceil(mat1)

% floor and ceiling function 

max(max(mat1)) % returns the exact value that ie maximum or max(A(:))

% WE can flip the matrix by flipup method

flipud(eye(9))
new = [ones(9,1),a]
